# TODO: 1.
#
#   In this module, we will be practicing our accumlator patterns. You will be
#   using the list of numbers above. It is a list containing 1000 numbers from
#   0 to 100 (inclusive).
#
#   For this _TODO_, write a block of code that loops through the list of
#   numbers and counts how many numbers are below 10. It should print the
#   result.
#
#   For your reference, there are 86 numbers that are less than 10.
#
#   Make sure you use the accumulator pattern for your solution.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
###############################################################################

###############################################################################
# TODO: 2.
#
#   For this _TODO_, write a block of code that adds up all the numbers in this
#   list. It should print the result.
#
#   For your reference, the answer is 49876.
#
#   Make sure you use the accumulator pattern for your solution.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

# TODO: 3.
#
#   For this _TODO_, write a block of code that creates a string of 0s and 1s
#   based on how many 0s and 1s are in the string. The 0s and 1s should appear
#   in the same order as they do in the list. It should print the result.
#
#   For your reference, the answer is "101111".
#
#   Make sure you use the accumulator pattern in your solution.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

###############################################################################
# TODO: 4.
#
#   For this _TODO_, write a block of code that splits the list into two lists:
#   one with all the numbers less than or equal to 50 and one with all the
#   numbers greater than 50. It should print the two lists.
#
#   For reference, your solution should end up with two lists that look
#   something like this.
#
#       Lower 50: [29, 45, 45, 28, ..., 30, 24, 34, 28]
#       Upper 50: [86, 83, 65, 65, ..., 90, 65, 89, 57]
#
#   Make sure you use the accumulator pattern in your solution.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
